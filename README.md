# Project-Test
 
This is another test! F 6th

Had to create a new repository in order to get it to work. 

Bonus work I did included creating the content to fill out my website such as the logo suite and the icons. 

Check out Image.png for reference to work in Illustrator. 

I also had to do a lot of troubleshooting to get this set up on my computer so hopefully I can replicate it all over again for Project 2.
